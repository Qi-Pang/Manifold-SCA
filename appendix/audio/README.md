# Audio

We upload all (total 2,552) audios reconstructed by our framework under Prime+Probe to folder `audio/sc09-pp`
for result verification. Each audio is named as `{Number}_{hash}_{index}.wav` and the
`{Number}` is the content of the corresponding reference input, e.g., for
a reconstructed audio `One_94de6a6a_nohash_1.wav`, the number said in the reference input
is *one*. As we reported in the paper, most (~80%) of the audios have
consistent contents (i.e., the numbers) with the reference inputs.
