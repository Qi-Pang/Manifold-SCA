# Vulnerabilities

We release the localized vulnerabilities in folder `vulnerability`. In folder
`vulnerability/contribution`, we list the corresponding *instruction addresses* of records
that make primary contribution to the reconstruction of media data. We further map
the pinpoined instructions back to the corresponding functions. These functions are
regarded as **side-channel vulnerable functions**. We list the results in
`{dataset}-{program}-count.json`, where higher counting indicates a higher possibility
of being vulnerable.

Despite each program is evaluated on different datasets, we can still observe that highly
consistent vulnerabilities are localized in the same program.
